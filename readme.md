Make your Backbone.js apps dance, with a composite application architecture!

## Backbone.Marionette

Backbone.Marionette is a composite application libarary for Backbone.js that
aims to simplify the construction of large scale JavaScript application through
common design and implementation patterns found in composite application
architectures, such as Microsoft's "Prism" framework. 

Unlike other composite application frameworks, Backbone.Marionette is designed 
to be a lightweigt and flexible library of tools that you can use when you want 
to. Like Backbone.js itself, you're not required to use all of 
Backbone.Marionette just because you want to use some of it.
